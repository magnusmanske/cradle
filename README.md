# Cradle
Cradle is a tool to help create Wikibase (eg Wikidata) items that are based on a specific pattern (eg "ancient ceramicist"). These patterns can be defined on-wiki as wikitext or ShEX. The user is then presented with a form that allows a hard-limited. soft-limites, or free addition of statements.

# Setup

## Config file
- Create a `config.js` JavaScript (_not_ JSON!) file in `public_html`. Make sure the donfig object remains valid JSON (keys in double quotes etc).
- Copy the code from `config.js.template`, and modify it according to your installation.
- Create an `oauth.ini` file with the OAuth data from your tool, on your wiki, in the tool root directory (_not_ `public_html`!):
```
[settings]
agent = YOUR_TOOL_NAME
consumerKey = FOO
consumerSecret = BAR
```

## Composer
Install the required PHP via composer:
```
composer install
```
